let maximum = parseInt(prompt("Enter the maximum number!"));: This line prompts the user to enter the maximum number for the guessing game and parses the input to an integer using parseInt.

while (!maximum) { maximum = parseInt(prompt("Enter a valid number!")); }: This while loop checks if the entered value is not a number. If the user enters a non-numeric value or cancels the prompt, it continues to prompt the user until a valid number is entered.

const targetNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * maximum) + 1;: This line generates a random integer between 1 and the maximum number entered by the user (inclusive). It's the number the user will try to guess.

let guess = prompt("Enter your first guess! (Type 'q' to quit)");: This line prompts the user to enter their first guess, and if they want to quit the game, they can type 'q'.

let attempts = 1;: This initializes a variable attempts to keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.

while (parseInt(guess) !== targetNum) { ... }: This while loop continues until the user's guess matches the target number or until the user decides to quit by entering 'q'. It checks if the parsed integer value of the user's guess is not equal to the target number.

Inside the while loop:

If the user enters 'q', the loop breaks, indicating that the user wants to quit the game.
If the guess is higher than the target number, the user is prompted to guess again with a message "Too high! Enter a new guess:".
If the guess is lower than the target number, the user is prompted to guess again with a message "Too low! Enter a new guess:".
If the input is not a number, the user is prompted to enter a valid number.
If the loop exits because the user guessed the correct number, it prints the message You got it! It took you ${attempts} guesses.

If the loop exits because the user quit the game by entering 'q', it prints the message "Ok, you quit!".
